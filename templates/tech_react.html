<h1>React</h1>
<main>
  <section class="overview">
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>React</strong> is a JavaScript library developed by Facebook for
      building user interfaces. It uses a component-based architecture, allowing
      developers to create reusable UI components and manage the application's
      state effectively.
    </p>
    <p>
      React makes it painless to create interactive UIs. Design simple views for
      each state in your application, and React will efficiently update and
      render just the right components when your data changes.

    <h2>Key Features of React</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Component-based Architecture:</strong> Build encapsulated
        components that manage their own state, then compose them to make
        complex UIs.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Virtual DOM:</strong> React creates an in-memory data structure
        cache, computes the resulting differences, and then updates the
        browserâ€™s displayed DOM efficiently.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>One-way Data Binding:</strong> Ensures that data flows in a
        single direction, making the application more predictable and easier to
        debug.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Strong Community and Ecosystem:</strong> A large ecosystem of
        libraries and tools that work well with React, such as Redux for state
        management, React Router for navigation, and many more.
      </li>
    </ul>

        <h3>Personal Kanban Board</h3>
        <p>
          Developed a Personal Kanban board application using React, TypeScript,
          and Firebase. This project helps users manage their tasks efficiently
          with features like drag-and-drop, data persistence, and cloud storage.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>React:</strong> Utilized React for building a dynamic and
            responsive user interface with component-based architecture.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>TypeScript:</strong> Leveraged TypeScript for static typing,
            which improves code quality and maintainability.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Drag-and-Drop:</strong> Implemented drag-and-drop
            functionality to allow users to move tasks between different stages
            (To Do, Doing, Done).
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Firebase:</strong> Integrated Firebase for real-time
            database functionalities, user authentication, and cloud storage.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Data Persistence:</strong> Ensured task data is saved and
            synchronized using Firebase Firestore.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Archive and Trash Boards:</strong> Added separate boards for
            archiving completed tasks and managing deleted tasks.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Search and Filter:</strong> Enabled users to search and
            filter tasks for better task management.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Dark Mode:</strong> Implemented a dark mode feature to
            enhance user experience and reduce eye strain in low-light
            environments.
